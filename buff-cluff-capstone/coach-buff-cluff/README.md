# Concept
A fully loaded Coaching web app that allows users to create/log into an account and save workouts that they have built using the the database of different exercises available to them. Along with that, they will be able to schedule virtual training sessions once they have logged in, as well as save 1 rep max data to their profile.

## MVP
- User registration/login
- Can create and save workouts
- Add notes to workouts
- Accessibility to complete library of exercises
- Max Calculator
- Can save maxes to profile
- Schedule training sessions

Pretty sure this will satisfy all the requirements on the checklist.
